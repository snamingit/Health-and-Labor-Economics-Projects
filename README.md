# Health-and-Labor-Economics-Projects

This repository contains different projects that examine the intersection of health and labor outcomes.The projects include:

1. Chronic Illness and Job Lock: Using NLSY79 data, the paper tests whether the source of health insurance creates incentives for  workers diagnosed with a a chronic illness to remain sufficiently employed to maintain access to health insurance coverage. I compare labor supply responses to new diagnoses of workers dependent on their own employment for health insurance with the responses of workers who are dependent on their spouseâ€™s employer for health insurance coverage. I find that workers who depend on their own job for health insurance are 1.5-5.5 percentage points more likely to remain employed and for those employed, are 1.3-5.4 percentage points less likely to reduce their labor hours and are 2.1-6.1 percentage points more likely to remain full-time workers. (Code to be uploaded later.)
